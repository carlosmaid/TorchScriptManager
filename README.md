# ScriptManager

![ScriptManager UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theCalcaholic/TorchScriptManager/media/media/scriptmanager_ui.png)

## Description
Allow only a curated whitelist of scripts (exact code match) to be run on your Space Engineers server.
Only scripts which match any of the whitelisted scripts exactly can be run in a Programmable Block.
This means that no configuration can be done in the code - scripts which require that need to be adapted
to use different configuration sources (e.g. custom data).
